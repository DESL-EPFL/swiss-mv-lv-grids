# The data
This repository contains excel files of Medium to Low Voltage grids of Switzerland. These grids are inferred by the work of [A. Oneto et. al.][https://www.techrxiv.org/users/706823/articles/691957-large-scale-generation-of-geo-referenced-power-distribution-grids-using-open-data?commit=8987643fe01b7ad759e009f562072ef91e48eae6]. The repository only provides the full dataset (of combined MV-LV grids), without any upgrade on the method. 
For any details, refer to the referenced work, or to the github repository [here][https://github.com/aeonetos/Swiss-PDGs].
